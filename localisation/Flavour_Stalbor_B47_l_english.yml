 B47_southern_heartland_title:0 "Southern Heartlands"
 B47_southern_heartland_desc:0 "After these first decades filled with constant strife against marauding bands of orcs and goblins, to say nothing of unscrupulous sellswords, we have finally managed to carve out a safe haven for our people. Joining us are the remnants of the Escanni populace, those loyal souls who didn’t abandon their devastated homeland for refuge in the western realms. Vernham will serve the beating heart of our realm, from which we will embark on a new beginning for Escann. But securing Vernham was merely the first step; many amongst our ranks clamor for further expansion into the unclaimed wastelands left by the Greentide. Most vocal among them are the veteran adventurers of ‘Arturo’s Watch’, who have set their sight on securing the strategic location of the Bladeskeep for our fledgling state."
 B47_bladeskeep_and_the_watch_title:0 "Our Watch begins"
 B47_bladeskeep_and_the_watch_desc:0 "Having secured the Bladeskeep both from orcish warbands and the competing claims of other adventurers, the members of Arturo’s Watch have lost no time in beginning the restoration of the imposing keep, fortifying it against all rival claimants. Their leadership has approached the $MONARCHTITLE$ and the other leaders forming the court of our newly minted realm with an intriguing proposal. They want to form an elite fighting force tasked with the duty to safeguard Stalbór and its peoples from enemies without and within. They envision Arturo’s Watch as part of our overall military forces, not subordinate to the general chain of command but instead accountable only to their Council of Watchers, led by Arturo or his eventual successor and the [leaderTitle] him/herself. If we were to agree to this proposal, we would need a clear and unambiguous agreement between the Watch and our government detailing their duties and the limits of their authority."
 B47_beginnings_of_a_city_title:0 "Rebuilding from the Ashes"
 B47_beginnings_of_a_city_desc:0 "Only the most inveterate optimist would have expected the astonishing revitalisation taking place in the former locations of the city of Vernham and its twin town of Old Vernham. Where until recently only charred ruins and the unburied corpses of their former inhabitants hinted at the formerly vibrant and bustling nature of these settlements, a veritable rebuilding frenzy has gripped both the newcomers planning to build a new life for themselves in the wilderness of Escann, and those former citizens who braved the dangers of a journey back to their former home to restore it to its former glory. With each day, the two settlements appear more like regular towns and less like lonely frontier outposts, but the perimeter of both towns is still cautiously guarded against the dangers of the wilderness beyond."
 B47_deepwood_gateway_title:0 "Unforeseen Encounters"
 B47_deepwood_gateway_desc:0 "Some of our scouts have discovered a hidden passage allowing entry into the deeper parts of the verdant Deepwoods. There they encountered elves unlike any they were familiar with from back home. From what they could deduce, these Wood Elves appear to be descended from moon elven warriors trapped in the Deepwoods during the War of the Sorcerer-King. Their long involuntary exile beneath the shade of the Deepwoods and the recent incursions of orcish warbands during the Greentide, however, has left them distrustful of outsiders. Our best chance to establish amicable relations with our new neighbors might be to enlist the aid of their by now distant moon elven relatives. Let us send out invitations to adventurous elves to come settle in Stalbór."
 B47_deepwood_relations_title:0 "Lion and Oak"
 B47_deepwood_relations_desc:0 "Our persistent efforts to gain the trust of our wood elven neighbors have been successful and our two peoples are increasingly connected by bonds of friendship and trust, with trade flowing freely between our lands. But the wood elves are not the only inhabitants of the verdant depths of this ancient forest. Mirroring the situation in Escann, both goblins and orcs can be found in the groves of the Deepwoods. Spurred on by the capricious desires of the otherworldly entities laying claim to dominion over these woods, both our new elven friends and the other mortal inhabitants of the Deepwoods are locked into a never ending series of futile struggles. Let us attempt to reconcile their differences and find a path to coexistence for all denizens of the Deepwoods."
 B47_the_early_cuirassiers_title:0 "Thundering Hooves"
 B47_the_early_cuirassiers_desc:0 "The wide open plains and gentle hills of southern Castanor from the heartland of Stalbór. It did not take long for horse breeders to utilize these advantageous conditions to establish thriving horse ranches with vast herds of sturdy and quick horses, bred from the remaining stock of tourney horses - once highly valued in chivalric Escann - mixed with prestigious Cannorian lineages. These uniquely Stalbórian horses have proven to be excellent mounts for our cavalry forces. Many of our knights refuse to ride a horse with a different pedigree, and liken the sound of a cavalry charge with these horses to the roar of a lion."
 B47_settle_deepwood_religious_dispute_title:0 "Out of the Forest’s Gloom"
 B47_settle_deepwood_religious_dispute_desc:0 "Bringing not only the wood elves but also the forest goblins and green orcs, each with competing claims on the glades of the Deepwoods, to the table has been no easy task. But by encouraging them to leave behind their superstitious awe regarding the fey infesting the deeper reaches of their forested homeland, or the misplaced admiration for the Dookanson, and instead to join us in devout harmony, a major step towards the unity of all denizens of the Deepwoods has been taken."
 B47_fey_steel_manufacturing_title:0 "Forging Fey Steel"
 B47_fey_steel_manufacturing_desc:0 "One particular trade good reaching our lands from the Deepwoods has caught the attention of Arturo’s Watch: fey steel, forged from iron ore extracted as a side product of the mining effort occurring in the Yfelorr silver mine. While as unyielding as any other steel, fey steel is curiously light, making it ideal for heavy armor. The Watch is eager to set up a branch in the Deepwoods tasked with securing exclusive access to fey steel and turning it into armor for our cuirassiers under the supervision of elven master blacksmiths."
 B47_the_winged_cuirassiers_title:0 "Winged Cuirassiers"
 B47_the_winged_cuirassiers_desc:0 ""The gentlest man cannot live in peace if it does not please his wicked neighbor." This Stalbóri proverb aptly describes the situation at the eve of the Wars of Consolidation in Escann. Where previously unclaimed lands stretched to the horizon, ambitious rulers are now confronted with the harsh truth that to expand their reach means waging war upon their neighbor. Deterring overly covetous neighbors has therefore become of prime importance for Stalbór, and the Winged Cuirassiers are the instrument of deterrence that has convinced many would-be conquerors to seek easier prey for their ambitions. Clad in fey steel armor and mounted upon strong Stalbóri steeds, the thunderous charge of the Winged Cuirassiers recalls the roar of the stone lions emblazoned on their armor."
 B47_regional_security_title:0 "Watchful Peace"
 B47_regional_security_desc:0 "The lands under the sway of Stalbór have been largely pacified, but it is an uneasy peace. The once wide open lands of Escann have been reclaimed by the many realms born from the ambitions of adventurers, exiled nobles and orcish warlords. Now these newborn realms circle each other like starving lions, each waiting for the opportunity to pounce and devour their neighbor. Compounding the issue are the many obscure cults who went with the pioneering settlers not out of a desire to rebuild what was lost in the Greentide, but to evade unwanted attention by the authorities in the west. To ensure the continued existence of Stalbór and keep our hard-won freedoms, our people must be willing to serve in our armies and fend off any attempts to subvert our destiny. Let both foreign enemies and devious cultists taste Stalbórian steel!"
 B47_western_heartland_title:0 "Western Heartlands"
 B47_western_heartland_desc:0 "Where once leaving the immediate vicinity of Vernham meant trading the watchful security of a border settlement for the untamed wilderness of post-Greentide Escann, now our citizens can travel to the foothills of the Godshield mountains or the shores of lake Silvermere, secure in the knowledge that Arturo’s Watch keeps a watchful eye on the roads of the realm and no harm may befall them."
 B47_eastern_heartland_title:0 "Eastern Heartlands"
 B47_eastern_heartland_desc:0 "Following the course of the Aldainé from lake Silvermere all the way to the foothills of the Serpentspine, Stalbór has secured its hold on all lands in southern Castanor between the Deepwoods and the Aldainé. The former dwarven hold of Ânumdihr, long since vacated by its first inhabitants and renamed to Marrhold by the Alenic tribe of the Marrodics, who made it the seat of their stalwart kingdom, has become the crown jewel of eastern Stalbór, with people from all over Stalbór and beyond traveling there in hopes of a new beginning."
 B47_vampires_of_arca_corvus_title:0 "Gateway to Dostanor"
 B47_vampires_of_arca_corvus_desc:0 "Wrestling Arca Corvur out of the grasp of Corvuria’s rulers and securing this strategic locale and ancient testament to the marvels of Castanorian architecture was no easy task. But once in our hands we shall not give it up without a fight. Arturo’s Watch has already made plans to turn the venerable fortress from the seat of power for an oppressive aristocracy into a beacon of liberty for the people of Dostanor. But first the remaining pockets of resistance in the deeper recesses of the sprawling fortress complex will have to be cleared out."
 B47_vampires_of_dostanor_title:0 "Tenebrous Threats"
 B47_vampires_of_dostanor_desc:0 "The discovery of undead fiends infesting the upper reaches of Corvurian society and quite literally draining the peasantry of their lifeblood has come as a profound shock to our people. Many, the members of Arturo’s Watch chief among them, have clamored for a sustained campaign of liberation to free the Corvurians from their vampiric overlords and bring them into the fold of Stalbór. Having secured the lands between Godshield and Daravan’s Folly, the Watch is now engaged in a prolonged campaign of clearing out every last hideout and sanctuary of the undead menace and ensuring that the shadows of the past no longer threaten the bright future of Corvuria’s children."
 B47_the_every_hold_title:0 "The Everyhold" 
 B47_the_every_hold_desc:0 "For many centuries, Marrhold has been known as the ‘Human Hold’, as it alone out of all the holds of hoary Aul-Dwarov has been settled by humans who remade it into their home. But this is no longer fitting, as since Marrhold fell into the hands of Stalbór members of many other races have found a home in the stone halls of Marrhold. With ever more levels of the hold being returned into a habitable state and with the hold now open to all, it’s seeing inhabitants from those that have long lived in the depth of the Serpentspine to those that have never stepped into a world without the open sky. And even some dwarves have returned to the former home of their distant ancestors. Therefore a new, more fitting moniker has gained popularity - the Everyhold, a hold for everyone!"
 B47_the_stalbor_fleet_title:0 "A Stalwart Fleet"
 B47_the_stalbor_fleet_desc:0 "For most of its history, Stalbór has been landlocked, but with our recent expansion into Daravan’s Folly, this is no longer the case. Not only are we now able to participate in the bountiful trade happening all along the shores of the Divenhal, but what until now has only been ominous rumors has become a shameful certainty. The orcish slave trade, abhorrent as it is to our eyes, has not been ended with our dominance over southern Castanor, but still flourishes until this day, with clandestine slave barges traveling down the Dostanesck to be met by unscrupulous slavers from the pirate haven of Nathalaire, who have made a profitable enterprise out of selling on their captive cargo to slave plantations, mines and labor camps all over Halcann and Aelantir. To prevent the continuation of this atrocity and liberate those unfortunates caught in this vile trade we require a powerful fleet capable of hunting down all slavers who dare to enslave our people."
 B47_orc_and_goblin_integration_title:0 "Healing old Wounds"
 B47_orc_and_goblin_integration_desc:0 "While orcs and goblins within our borders have enjoyed the protection of the law the same as any other inhabitant of our lands, provided they were in turn willing to adhere to the laws of Stalbór, ever since the proclamation of the Vernham Homestead Act, the resentments and mistrust caused by the Greentide meant that they tended to congregate in communities set apart from the rest of Stalbórian society. It is long overdue to set aside old grudges and begin healing those old wounds lest they fester. Let us properly integrate our orcish and goblinic neighbors and ensure that all inhabitants of our lands are treated equally."
 B47_expansion_of_the_vernham_act_title:0 "The Vernham Homestead Act"
 B47_expansion_of_the_vernham_act_desc:0 "The original Vernham Homestead Act was a piece of legislation that was revolutionary for its time. Granting law-abiding orcs and goblins legal protections against reprisals by vengeful settlers and providing them with a place in society instead of driving them away, was a solution to the task of reconciling conflicting interests of settlers and former members of the Greentide that was unique in post-Greentide Escann. But the provisions in the original act have not kept up well with the changing times and are in dire need of a revision to be a better fit for a flourishing realm that has long since outgrown its pioneering roots. By now orcs and goblins are not the only races aside from humans who populate our lands. By expanding the Vernham act to include elves, dwarves, gnomes and halflings we will surely attract many skillful new settlers whose diverse perspectives can only enrich our growing society."
 B47_orc_and_half_orc_soliders_and_generals_title:0 "Tusked Warriors"
 B47_orc_and_half_orc_soliders_and_generals_desc:0 "Unlike many of their compatriots in Escann, the orcs and half-orcs living in our lands were not treated as second class subjects, abused as slaves, driven from their homes or even hunted down like animals. Instead the Vernham Homestead Act enabled a peaceful coexistence. And whether due to natural proclivities or a patriotic sense of duty, many orcs and half-orcs have gravitated towards a life as a career soldier. Steadily rising through the ranks, they have become an integral part of our army and many of our generals possess prominent tusks and a greenish complexion. It is in our best interest to actively support this development and encourage those amongst the settled Dargom orcs who wish to fully integrate into Stalbórian society, and find a way to channel the fierce warrior spirit of the Ozdan orcish nomads into recruitment opportunities for our troops."
 B47_expansion_of_the_vernham_act_2_title:0 "Monstrosity of Prejudice"
 B47_expansion_of_the_vernham_act_2_desc:0 "Fuelled by fear, anger and prejudice cloaked in religious dogma, sentient beings of many races have been labeled as ‘monstrous’ for millenia. Whether they are the harpies and gnolls of the sunbaked south or the kobolds and trolls of the frozen north, these races thriving on the edges of Cannorian civilization have long been regarded askance and their cultural practices were considered barbaric. While it can not be refuted that during some time periods and in some lands the traditions and practices of realms populated and ruled by these races have indeed been vile, this should not mean that all members of these races should be painted with the same monstrous brush. All those that want to participate in our new society should enjoy the protections granted by the Vernham Homestead Act."
 B47_vernham_urbanization_title:0 "A New Metropolis"
 B47_vernham_urbanization_desc:0 "The twin cities of Vernham and Old Vernham have risen far above their humble beginnings as frontier outposts erected in the charred ruins of their pre-Greentide predecessors. By now they have started to merge into a continuous metropolis, bustling with inhabitants hailing from all over Halcann. The question on the minds of the government officials responsible for the administration of the capital is whether an attempt should be made to remake Vernham in the image of fallen Castonath and recapture the lost glory of Castanor, or whether Vernham is a new metropolis for a new age with an uniquely Stalbórian essence."
 B47_secure_the_south_title:0 "Our Southern Shores"
 B47_secure_the_south_desc:0 "Having liberated Corvuria from their parasitic vampire overlords, pacified the gnoll-infested Folly and conquered the coastal lands of Ourdia, southern Escann is now firmly within our grasp and the latest addition to the many lands under our sway. These new lands are however separated from the core of our realm by impassable mountains and inhospitable swamps, leaving their inhabitants vulnerable to the predations of foreign powers. We must ensure that our holdings are properly fortified to deter any opportunistic raider or would-be conqueror. Both the restoration of ancient Castanorian citadels and the construction of new fortifications is needed to secure the south."
 B47_the_great_keep_title:0 "The Great Keep"
 B47_the_great_keep_desc:0 "Over the last decades and centuries our builders have uncovered many secrets of their craft long thought lost by studying the construction of architectural marvels like the Marrhold or the Castanorian Citadels. And they do not rely solely on the discovered practices of the ancients, but have developed innovative solutions for the many issues caused by the reconstruction of entire cities and massive fortifications. It is now time to put that expertise to good use and erect the greatest fortification Escann has ever seen on the former site of the Bladeskeep. May the Great Keep develop an even more exalted reputation than its illustrious predecessor."
 B47_expansion_of_the_vernham_act_3_title:0 "Friends We Have Yet To Meet"
 B47_expansion_of_the_vernham_act_3_desc:0 "The rise of Stalbór from mercenary frontier outpost to established empire has been nothing short of meteoric. With our new role as the hegemon of Escann and the discovery of distant lands by intrepid Cannorian explorers, many travelers with unusual features have begun to arrive at our shores. Harimari tigerfolk from the distant east, mutable Lizardfolk from the deep south, far-traveling Centaurs, diligent Hobgoblins, the distant kin of our goblins, sturdy ogres and even the rare Ruinborn, long-lost kin to our elves, and even stranger newcomers from the other side of the world. Let us welcome them, one and all, for Stalbór will always open its doors to those coming with amicable intentions, no matter their origin. All sentients willing to coexist peacefully with each other shall enjoy the same protections and responsibilities under the law."
 B47_the_watch_over_cannor_title:0 "The Watch over Cannor"
 B47_the_watch_over_cannor_desc:0 "Arturo’s Watch has been instrumental in guarding Stalbór against enemies from without as well as from within since its founding. But the ambitions of the Watch do not end at the borders of Stalbór. As the Watch has been fiercely protective of its relative independence since its founding many years ago, its leadership has now declared the intention of establishing new Watch chapters far beyond our borders and promote the ideal of peaceful coexistence of all sentient races and protection under the law for all who are willing to abide by it to the rest of Cannor. Let us hope for the sake of all inhabitants of Cannor and beyond that their efforts bear fruit!"
 B47_complete_acceptance_title:0 "Sanctuary for All"
 B47_complete_acceptance_desc:0 "Stalbór may be a realm amongst others, one place of many on the map of Halcann, but more importantly, it is an ideal - the ideal of peaceful coexistence amongst all sentients. We have become a sanctuary for all beings fleeing persecution, prejudice or subjugation simply for the crime of existing. Here in our lands the slate is wiped clean and it is not their race or faith but their own virtues and shortcomings that will determine their fate. It is not an uncommon sight in our cosmopolitan cities to see the gnomish clockmaker setting up shop next to a lizardfolk alchemist, a dwarven smith or a harpy messenger. We are a safe haven for everyone and everyone may have a place amongst our ranks."

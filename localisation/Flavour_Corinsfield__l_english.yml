 H35_lights_in_shadow_desc:0 "Too long have we found ourselves defenseless against the sharpened spears and wicked witchery of the rune warriors. If we truly wish to forge a holy empire to stand against not only the witch and the wizard, but the shaman as well, then first we must follow in the words and actions of our Lady and pick up our swords and shields. To this end, we must create a militia of men of the utmost faith and training. Soon then, may we strike back against our innumerable enemies."
 H35_beginning_sentries_title:0 "Beginning The Sentries"
 H35_beginning_sentries_desc:0 "For too long have we suffered such grievous abuses at the hands of the rune warriors. They saw fit to attack us with their foul magics and slaughter a third of our number before our feet had even found our soil; we shall repay the favor tenfold. Let us arm our men with the finest weaponry, forge them the strongest armor, and imbue them with the most righteous spirit, and let us charge into the dwellings of the savages and let none — no woman, man, nor heathen child — survive. We will flense their witch-drawn scribbles clean from their hide, if we must."
 H35_organizing_leadership_title:0 "Organizing The Leadership"
 H35_organizing_leadership_desc:0 "While our grand Sentries are not in want of weapons or training, we lack goodmen wizened in the ways of warfare. From our stock, let us pull those with the most righteous fire held within their hearts and name them leaders. Just as we devote ourselves to the Martyr, let our Sentries devote themselves to their new leaders; through fire and war shall they lead them."
 H35_land_redistribution_title:0 "Land Redistribution"
 H35_land_redistribution_desc:0 "It has become abundantly clear to us that the savage river-worshippers simply have no clue how to farm. The crops they grow are diminutive in size and lack flavor; famines and plagues wrack their countryside every winter. Clearly, the degenerative and disinterested attitudes of their kings, no doubt encouraged by their retinue of witches, has caused this rot to spread throughout the countryside. We will seize this land and redistribute it to goodmen who wish to help their fellow man, and know the proper Corinsfielder ways of farming. The previous owners will be allowed to stay, of course - the farms will need labor, after all."
 H35_breadbasket_of_aelantir_title:0 "Breadbasket of Aelantir"
 H35_breadbasket_of_aelantir_desc:0 "For the first harvest in centuries, nary a goodman has starved. Our experiments in crop rotation have ensured that our people are fed, year-round; even throughout the most dire of winters, our stockpiles remain bountiful. With the end of famine, the Crimson Reverend can finally proclaim one of the nation’s oldest enemies as good as dead. Our children grow healthier, and healthy children develop into fine soldiers and righteous priests - the better to fight our eternal enemy."

 H35_banks_of_corynn_desc:0 "Through persecution, pursuit, and plague, we have persisted. From our ruined homes in Escann, to the cruel seas and the sheer cliffs of the Ruin, to the savage rune warriors of these plains, here the Martyr has finally guided us to bountiful fields, to rolling hills of red poppies and green grass. Here, we will survive — no, here we will thrive, and never again shall we be crushed under the iron boot of wizardry, be it sorcerers or shamans.\n\nNever. again."

 H35_securing_veykoda_desc:0 "We are not alone. Our vicious rivals, the rune warriors with their foul magics and savage dispositions, are not our only competitors for the throne of Aelantir. Cannorians have infested our holy plains, bringing with them the foul wizards of the old world. First amongst them are the hedonist halflings of West Tipney, too preoccupied with pipeweed and pumpkins to realize that their enemies aren’t the humans who siege their homeland but the mages who control them; second amongst them are the dwarven smiths of Argezvale, absorbed within their folly that they can befriend the savages; last amongst this unholy host are the bandits, sinners, and ne’er-do-wells of New Havoral, who preach that all are equal, long as they can pick a pocket or slit a throat. We must save them all from their foolish notions."

 H35_raising_defenses_desc:0 "Just as the turtle was gifted a strong shell to protect itself from ravenous predators, we too must protect ourselves from the destructive impulses of wizardry. It is no secret that all other nations, those cruel mageocracies, wish us to be crushed underfoot. Let not a single soldier pass into our nation; let watchful eyes guard a fort in every town. Let Corinsfield become a grand stone turtle unto itself, to protect our nation, our companions, and our faith forevermore."

 H35_safe_at_last_desc:0 "The Veykoda has been united under our grasp; travelers can venture from Poppyspring to Havorton without fear of savages, bandits, or magic. Now, we must look inwards. Families must grow large and happy, the Sentries must grow strong and disciplined, and the Inquisitors must continue their holiest work of burning out the vile stain of witchery.\nWe will bide our time.\nYes, we will grow.\nAnd once we have grown…\n\nMay our faithful strike terror into the hearts of all mages."

 H35_further_farmlands_desc:0 "“For goodness without action means nothing,”\n“And from nothing the roots of evil will fester,”\n\nWe have sat idle for long enough. We have built a strong nation of neighbors and a bulwark against witchery and all who would oppose us. Just as Corin struck her sword into the heart of the dread mage Dookanson, so shall we destroy the center of maleficarum in Aelantir! March, goodman, onwards! Today, we liberate the Ynn!"
 H35_dams_and_dome_title:0 "Dams and The Dome"
 H35_dams_and_dome_desc:0 "One of the most essential parts of the reeducation of the Ynnic peoples into Corinsfielder society is the destruction of the heretical garbage they hold dear. Without these idols most unholy to guide them in their worship, confused and dazed, they §Gwill§! turn to the Martyr of Escann for strength and willpower; from there, the majority of our job is already complete.\n\nThe only stickling point here is how, exactly, to deal with these monuments. To destroy them would be righteous, yes, but they are of immense value; perhaps our most righteous efforts could turn a profit, as well."
 H35_crimson_cathedral_title:0 "The Crimson Cathedral"
 H35_crimson_cathedral_desc:0 "Now that the previously heretical Ynnics have seen the light of the Crimson Lady, they need another monument to look towards and admire, somewhere for their hearts to wander in times of need and despair. That goes for the common folk as well, all need her light, all need her blessing.\n\nSo it shall be done, with faith and hope in our hearts, we shall construct a monument worthy of her grace!"
 H35_settlement_surveys_title:0 "Settlement Surveys"
 H35_settlement_surveys_desc:0 "If we wish to master these lands, first we must understand them. Leave no nook unmapped, no cranny undiscovered, and no stone unturned. We must know our neighbors, and verily we must hate them, for any nation held under sway of magery is thine own enemy in our heart of hearts."
 H35_maleficar_sympathizers_title:0 "Maleficar Sympathizers"
 H35_maleficar_sympathizers_desc:0 "Hundreds hiding amongst the newly conquered peoples have been marked for death. These foul wretches, the witches and warlocks intermixed within their towns and forts - all must be forced out and put to the noose or the pyre. None with the potential can be suffered to live; even a single one has the potential for untold tragedy. So, righteous men of Corinsfield, with the holy flame of our Lady in your heart, order yourselves as to find these witches and put them to the sword — put the ones hiding them to the sword, and put their mothers and brothers and sons and daughters to the sword. [b]Never[/b] again shall the mages rule us."

 H35_ban_sex_title:0 "Cultural Crackdown"
 H35_ban_sex_desc:0 "The Ynnics cannot be permitted to continue to languor in their degeneracy. We must go in with flame and sword and purge all elements of magery within their number. It may be bloody - but their children shall thank us. By the Martyr, the savages will be brought to heel and shown proper civilization - no matter how many must be sent to her."
 H35_safety_from_sin_title:0 "Safety from Sin"
 H35_safety_from_sin_desc:0 "Aelantir has been freed from the malevolent forces that have strangled it for far too long. Magery, witchery, shamanism - call it what you want, for it is now a vague memory in the minds of most. Our enemies have been detoothed and declawed, and find themselves completely at our bountiful mercies.\n\nFamilies want not for food nor faith; every home has bountiful supplies of bread and cheese, and every young mind has been matured and shaped by our schools.\n\nThe fools of the Veykoda and the savages of the Ynn have been fully pacified and converted. Any whelp, be they halfling, ruinborn, or Havoralic, know of our Lady, our Father, and our mission.\n\nIn Corinsfield, all is well. All is good."
 H35_father_and_daughter_title:0 "Father and Daughter"
 H35_father_and_daughter_desc:0 "Once upon a time, in a land far far away, there was a young man who lived happily with his beautiful wife and their beautiful daughter. Then plague took his wife, so the man took his daughter and moved to what seemed to be greener pastures. However, what malady began, maleficarum finished, and the man found himself bereft. Every day for ten long years, the old man awoke at the crack of dawn to search for his daughter.\n\nOne day, he found her.\n\nAnd that’s when he realized that there was no recompense for witchery but death."
 H35_first_mage_trials_title:0 "The First Mage Trials"
 H35_first_mage_trials_desc:0 "The single greatest talent of the witch is betrayal. The witch is not always some cackling old hag who lives in a fetid swamp in a great hut made of the bones of children - they might be your trusted neighbor; greet you early, and then curse your cattle to starve your family after the sun drops from view. They could be your beloved wife; kiss you goodbye in the morn when you go to tend the fields, and steal the life from your beloved child whilst you are away. They could even be your beloved child, waiting for their chance to strike with a poisoned blade into your heart whilst you drift off to sleep. So love thy neighbor, cherish thy family — but always remember they could be traitors to your country, your home, and your God. Our newest order of inquisitors, men of the most righteous faith, shall hunt these vermin to no end - until we are free."

 H35_liturgical_literacy_title:0 "Liturgical Literacy"
 H35_liturgical_literacy_desc:0 "In order for our nation to function, we need learned men. Faith and righteousness will only get us so far - if we wish to truly understand the commandments of Father and Martyr alike, then we must ensure our couters can not just read, but understand. This has not been a problem in Poppyspring, or the areas surrounding it; however, the rural areas where we have not exercised such control have fallen to the wayside. A grand center of learning shall we build, then, and encourage these righteous goodmen from the borders to attend. Investment in them can only benefit us down the line."
 H35_common_corin_education_title:0 "Common Education"
 H35_common_corin_education_desc:0 "No longer shall we continue like the heretic ilk of Cannor; let not the most exclusive knowledge of the world be held so greedily by our rich. No - unto the heads of each and every goodman of Corinsfield shall the most inspired knowledge be imparted. We shall teach them their letters, we shall teach them their abilities, and - most importantly - we shall teach them in the matters of unbreakable faith. Let the torches of knowledge and faith be lit in tandem, and let their blinding flames burn away the false knowledge of heretics and heathens."
 H35_corinspoppy_compact_title:0 "Corinspoppy Compact"
 H35_corinspoppy_compact_desc:0 "Let us declare a great companionship between all the good people of Corinsfield. In the name of our Lady we shall give our lives. We shall not suffer the rule of neither tyrant king nor greedy merchant, but instead let our faith alone guide us. Let each town be administered by the gentle hand of their spiritual guides, and from amongst themselves let these holies name one Crimson Reverend to speak for all the nation. As the bountiful Corinspoppies bind our feet to our soil and our souls to the Martyr of Escann, let this contract bind each and every neighbor forevermore."
 H35_piety_of_masses_title:0 "Piety of the Masses"
 H35_piety_of_masses_desc:0 "The venerable amongst us have begun to depart for the more hallowed planes. Soon, very soon, there will be few amongst us who have trodden in the verdant grasses of Escann. However, this may not be a bad thing. With our new homelands come new ideals, and sooner, rather than later, the worthy boots of these worthy holy men shall be filled once more - now, by goodmen who believe wholeheartedly in our most divine mission since their birth. Furthermore, we shall do away with needless stratification altogether; little need have we for greaves, bevors, or helms when all men are equal in death."
 H35_in_proper_company_title:0 "In Proper Company"
 H35_in_proper_company_desc:0 "To some, the death of a child might be a tragedy. However, it must be questioned by the goodmen; what is the death of one child compared to the death of hundreds, from pointless wars or cruel experiments? Verily, the ending of one life then is not that cruel a price to pay. Thereby must we live, as Corinsfielders. Let the foul little witchings be dashed upon the rocks to save thousands of worthy children later. Lo, verily let the eye of suspicion fall upon the mother if her mourning be so great, for one who does not understand the small sacrifices we all must make for the Martyr of Escann is as dangerous to our people as a witch."
 H35_blessed_book_title:0 "The Blessed Book"
 H35_blessed_book_desc:0 "For too long, our holiest doctrine has been under the foul sway of a most terrible thing - tradition. If we seek true righteousness, we need total uniformity in our faith. Else, the poor common man finds his mind open to the malefictions of witches and mages and heathens - this will not do. Our most learned goodmen and the good Crimson Reverend shall convene; from our scattered books of hymns and the memories of our beknighted ancestors we shall forge a book for all good Corinsfielders to hold close to their heart, knowing they shall never stray from the path."
 H35_father_godwin_title:0 "Godwin's Dream"
 H35_father_godwin_desc:0 "The most virtuous society that our Father once dreamed of has nearly been achieved. The stain of Witchery has been uprooted in every town of Corinsfield, and every goodman, goody, and child of Corinsfield reveres the Martyr just as they should. We have even struck into the heart of heathenry and sorcery and seen its inhabitants converted and contained. No longer must we focus on our center; now, it is time for us to launch a crusade the likes of which the world has never seen. Let all mages, sorcerers, shamans, what-have-you, fear us - for the righteous fury of the sons and daughters of Corinsfield shall drag them to hell."
 H35_corin_country_title:0 "Corin's Country"
 H35_corin_country_desc:0 "The most faithful aims, once thought totally impossible, have been achieved. The magery of the surrounding nations has been purged, totally; the nations’ peoples may not be satisfied with the killings, but they will see the necessity in time. As the decaying mageocracies of Cannor rip each other apart in the names of vanity, gluttony, pride, and sin, let all in Aelantir prosper in the absence of witchery most foul."

Most offensive of all, however, are their tattoos - onto their very skin do they inscribe their magic, ensuring that each and every one of their number is granted the insidious and hideous power of the witch.\n\nNo longer shall this be permitted to continue.

On his record are multiple cases where he was flogged by his superiors for defying orders to attack Veykodan camps where “innocents” such as women and children - [i]innocents, bah![/I] - had not yet fled.

Such excess for the dead while the living are left to starve and rot is sickening - however, a large section of couters greatly protest disturbing the dead, even if they themselves do not believe in these pagan rituals.

The great lands held by the nobles have been confiscated by Red Sentry and Inquisitor alike and given back to the people over whom they once held dominion and thus, destitute and starved, is their hold broken.\n\nNow, however, comes the logistically difficult issue. The Witch. While we were able to purge witchery from our former conquered neighbors, halfling and dwarf, they weren’t as… [I]entrenched[/e] as the water mages of Ynnic society.

They were some of the first converts to the Martyr of Escann’s good faith - Godwin himself being one of the very first of the couters, the priests who dedicated themselves to the Martyr’s worship - and there they lived a good life.\n\nA plague that swept the countryside tore his wife away from him. So, seeking greener grass, he took his daughter and moved to the neighboring kingdom of Esthíl, which offered generous grants of land to any Corinite pilgrims who wished it. There, they made a new home and found a community in their fellow pilgrims in a small village long since forgotten.\n\nOne day, late in the night, Godwin heard screams. He could open his eyes and look about, but found himself unable to move his limbs - a man paralyzed. All he could see from the dark edges of his vision were cloaked figures dragging out a sack. In the morning, his daughter was gone.\n\nEvery day he would go stand in the streets of their village and cry for help. But, even though the man and daughter were part of the village, none ever stopped to assist him. Even as more and more of the young people of the village seemed to go missing, the community never banded together to help one another. That was the way of things until one day when a strange man, clad in the same cloak he saw on that fateful night approached him. The man introduced himself as Calas, and told him one simple statement.\n\n“I know where your daughter is.” And so, he brought Father Godwin to a small building, far from any homes. In it, rickety wooden stairs led down, down, down, into the dark.\n\nGodwin opened the doors at the bottom of the staircase. There, he saw bodies - hundreds of them. Sickly, pale covered in scars and bruises, with most being mutilated in some way. Some missed their arms and legs, some had spare arms and legs crudely sown on. Each and every single body had the glazed over eyes of one long since dead, and yet their breath shallowly drew still. Occasionally, a scream, shrill and piercing, would cry out. Some had veins running to clear sacs filled with strange fluids, brightly colored and violently bubbling.\n\nNot a single body seemed to be older than thirty years. Here were the missing.\n\n“The lords of Esthíl seek power,” was the only explanation provided by Calas, “and they have forsaken whatever humanity they had.”\n\nOff to the side of the room is where he found her. She drew breath, but no longer resided in the land of the living.\n\nIn an instant, it was as if a tinder struck within his heart. Father Godwin heard a voice speak to him. A woman’s voice - he wondered at first if it was his daughter, but dismissed the thought in an instant. No. The voice was the Martyr of Escann, and she told him words that he would remember until the end of his days.\n\n“Look upon their works, good Father, and know that the only recompense for witchery is death.”\n\nThe next week he returned,  now accompanied by the rest of the village. They had to see what had been done to their children. And they, too, needed to learn the truth.\n That the only recompense for witchery is death.\n\nThey decided to burn the foul building and put the miserable wretches out of their misery. Watching the flames rise, Father Godwin prayed to the Martyr. His thoughts lingering on his daughter’s twisted form, he knew in his heart - the old world is irreparably stained by the foul taint of magic. Their future lies in the new world."

 H35_gp_crimson_cathedral_desc:0 "At the heart of Pilgrim’s Field a veritable marvel of the Corinite faith rises towards the blue sky, proclaiming to all who behold its many spires the majesty, grace and benevolence of the maiden Martyr of Escann and her Regent Court.\n\nThanks to the unrelenting efforts of the Corinite faithful, the Cathedral of Crimson Grace proudly stretches skywards where prior to the arrival of Cannorians only wild animals and Veykodan tribes roamed. It may not be composed of precious gold and marble as the famed Golden Dome of Stanyrhrada was, but its imposing spires, made from the finest timber found in all of Sarda and Veykoda, and intricate woodwork carvings depicting tales out of the Blessed Book for the edification of the faithful are truly a wonder to behold, inspiring pious awe in all who observe the Cathedral.’"
